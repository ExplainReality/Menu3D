In this repository you find the Menu created for the VR headset. This menu accesses the camera data of the VR headset and by applying the traind model, it cretes the bounding boxes/segmented parts onto the presented objects. This is a Mixed reality project.
This part is only for the Menu option. For the backend*machine learning and dataset collection), please use the ML-VR-MR repository, in which we include all other data.
